# Introduction to predictive modeling in Spark with applications in pharmaceutical bioinformatics
Spark is a genearal cluster computing engine for large-scale data processing. In this repository we store tutorials, and relating code, to get started with Spark predictive modeling. Even if the main focus here is pharmaceutical bioinformatics, the presented methodologies
are generally applicable, hence the following tutorials represent a good starting point for everione is interested in 
learning Spark.

## Getting started
In order to get your hands dirty, writing some code, you first need to have access to a Spark environment. Off course, having access to
cloud resources or to a Spark bare-metal installation is expensive, and time consuming in terms of set up. Hence, to get started it is
preferrable to setup a single machine environment on your computer. This will be useful even later on, when you will deploy your
Spark applications to a production environmen, as you allways want to test your code locally first. My recipe to get this on your 
local machine, is a bit unconventional if compared to other Spark's getting started tutorials. I believe that IDEs improve software
developers productivity, therefore Scala IDE will be the first ingredient (http://scala-ide.org/). Scala IDE, comes with an integrated
Maven plugin, that you will use in order to pull Spark and all of its dependencies. Fianlly, and optionally, you will push
your Spark exercises to GitHub.
